Menu Teleport System

Create a program using the sample notecard and drop it on the teleport object. This will store all the programming information and it will be available to every telport object using the application. You can arrange the destinations by category and the dialogs will use them.

You will find the sql to create the table in the sql directory. The script and programming notecard are in the lsl directory. And the ammplication its self is in the menu directory

If you have multiple teleports in the same region, you may need to change the communication channels in the script.
